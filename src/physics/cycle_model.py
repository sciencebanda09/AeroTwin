"""Physically consistent single-spool turbojet Brayton-cycle model with variable gas properties.

Station convention. This module's public station labels (p2/t2, p3/t3, p4/t4)
match the dataset schema exactly as specified in the challenge problem
statement's measurement table, NOT the classical Brayton-cycle numbering:

    Symbol   Challenge label            Physical station
    ------   -------------------------  --------------------------------
    P2, T2   Compressor Exit            downstream of the compressor
    P3, T3   Combustor Exit             = turbine inlet (challenge PDF
                                         explicitly calls T3 "Turbine
                                         Inlet Temperature")
    P4, T4   Turbine Exit               downstream of the turbine

An unlabeled freestream/ambient inlet station (call it station "1", ram
compression from ambient conditions) exists internally between the ambient
boundary condition and the compressor, but is not part of the reported
schema and has no output field. Earlier revisions of this module
incorrectly treated p2/t2 as the *compressor inlet* (i.e. used the
classical numbering rather than the challenge's), which silently
misaligned every downstream equation with the actual dataset columns and
produced systematically biased Thrust/TSFC predictions (physics-only
R² as low as -115 on TSFC). This revision fixes that station mapping.
